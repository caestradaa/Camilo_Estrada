- Project tools: SQL Server for loading and cleaning data (**[SQL file][sqlfile]**). And SQL and Python for exploratory and explanatory analysis on a **[Jupyter notebook][notebook]** via %sql magic.
- It was found that during the first six months after the start of vaccination, there has been a slight decrease in the fatality rate. The change has been slow and only begins to be noticeable after the seventh month (09-2021). In the last two months fatality rate has decreased on average by 28%
