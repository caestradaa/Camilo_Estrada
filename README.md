- Data: Covid-19 positive cases data in Colombia from the National Institute of Health (**4.9M records**). Vaccination data extracted from the official Our World in Data repository (208 rows).
- Tools: **SQL Server** for loading, cleaning and exploring data (**[SQL][sqlfile]**). **Python** for explanatory analysis on a **[Jupyter notebook][notebook]**.
- During the first six months after the start of vaccination, fatality rate has slightly decrease and it is only noticeable after the seventh month (09-2021). In the last two months fatality rate has decreased by 28% on average.
